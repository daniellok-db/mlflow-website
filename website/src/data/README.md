# Adding a logo to the "Powered By" page

Follow these steps to add an organization logo to the "Powered By" page:

1. Add the logo SVG file to `/static/img/companies/color`.
2. Edit the `companies.json` file. The key is the company's display name (it's used for
   alt/hover text on the image), and the value is an object containing the company's URL and logo source path from Step 1.
